# mame -listxml

Step one is grab a bunch of roms, eg from https://archive.org/

now we try and sort through mame roms and remove the ones that do not 
make sense on a real mamecab, eg drop the mahjong and the home 
computers and mechanical etc etc.

Hardcoded decisions so it is up to you to mess with js/sort.js and 
change the filtering if you want.

This is nodejs so should work anywhere but we are assuming you are 
using bash here.

First clone this repo and cd into it then...

	npm install
	./mamelist

This will install dependencies and do a test run that will also explain 
the command line options available.

From here on we assume your mame files are in ~/mame/ so your roms are 
in ~/mame/roms/ you will need to adjust that if they are somewhere 
else. First get listxml from your mame, this does assume you have mame 
installed and working.

	mame -listxml >~/mame/mamelist.xml

Then convert this xml file to a json file with some info striped and 
some info added, this will only include roms that you have. Think of 
this json as enough information for a reasonable launcher.

	./mamelist parse --dir ~/mame

Finally we make a ~/mame/romsort with subdirectories full of sorted 
roms, these roms are hardlinked files so do not actually take up any 
more space.

	./mamelist sort --dir ~/mame

Now I can copy the roms I want from these directories to my arcade cab, 
I actually only care about 19xx so I just grab that dir. What to do 
here is up to you, the roms have been sorted into folders and I found 
that rather helpful, for me it dropped a lot of files that I do not 
care about as they do not make sense in a real arcade machine.

There will be duplicates, so best to merge them all into one folder 
when copying.
