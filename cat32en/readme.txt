--- CLASSIFICATION FILES FOR MAME ---

This project is born and is based on the pre-existen catlist, maintained by Triggerfin, on http://www.mameworld.net/catlist. It is in NO WAY intended to replace this project, it is limited to carry it on until Triggerfin finds the time and the way to update his procedures, and update all his files.

All updates are published on http://www.progettoemma.net/?catlist and are maintained by me, SWOS and Scuore

The project is composed by 4 files: 
- CAT32: Game classifications to be used in MAME32: unpack all files in the FOLDER directory of your mame32 (or compatible emu) folder, run your emulator and you will find the classification in the folders column in the left.
- DELUXE32: detailed classification, for mame32, classifying the games by genre and then by cathegory.
- CATVER: classification by cathegory and version, compatible with many frontends, eg mamewah.
- GENREV: classification by genre and version, compatible with many frontends, eg mamewah.
